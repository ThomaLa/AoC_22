# Advent of code 2022

Playing with julia this year, hopefully will stick to it.

The code doesn't work as-is, you'd need to change the `to_path(arg)` function in
`base.jl` to put a typical path to your downloaded inputs.

Once this is done, confirm I'm not lying by storing some inputs somewhere and
running e.g. `julia day_32.jl test`.

(Who am I kidding, no one will ever use these anyways)
